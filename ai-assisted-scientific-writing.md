The use of AI language models in scientific writing can be beneficial in improving the quality of communication, as it has the ability to detect errors, suggest better wording, and identify any areas in need of clarification. This ultimately enhances the efficacy of the composition and serves the purpose of effectively communicating scientific ideas.

Despite its potential, some have concerns about its use. One important consideration when using AI for scientific writing is that it may produce incorrect facts, potentially compromising the accuracy and integrity of the message. It is therefore important for authors to understand the limitations of AI models and only use them for improving the wording; relying on them to generate original ideas or frame logical arguments should be avoided. It is the responsibility of the writer to ensure that any verbiage adapted from AI is accurate and reliable.
